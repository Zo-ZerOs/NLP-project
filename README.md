ðŸ“ˆ Decode BitCoin Trends with Machine learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP): Predicting Emotions from Texts on Twitter

## Abstract
 
In recent months, Many Thai investors have been interested in cryptocurrency investing. According to  SEC, The number of trading accounts has been found to continue to increase every month since the beginning of 2021, at the rate of 50,000 - 100,000 accounts per month. Many research studies have analyzed the correlation between bitcoin price fluctuation and social sentiments using big data analytics and natural language processing techniques.  However, there is still a lack of study in the Thai language. So it might be worthwhile to look into the correlation between bitcoin price fluctuation and social sentiments of Thai people. In this work, we present a data set of Thai Tweets covering half a year compared with bitcoin's closed price (BTC/THB). Additionally, We show the comparison in another aspect such as bitcoin's price (BTC/THB) change in percent. 
	
We hypothesize that Thai people always voice their opinion on social media, such as Twitter. When the bitcoin price goes up, they tend to comment about bitcoin in positive ways. On the other hand, they will negatively comment about bitcoin if the price is going down. To prove this hypothesis, we collect  Tweets of Thai people about bitcoin and perform sentiment analysis. Then, compare them with the value of bitcoin in accordingly time. Our results show that sentiment strongly correlates with bitcoin's price change in percent, and information on Twitter may be used to analyze the price fluctuation.
